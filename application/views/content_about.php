    If you are building a large application you might find it convenient to 
	organize your controllers into sub-folders. CodeIgniter permits you to do this.

Simply create folders within your application/controllers directory and place
 your controller classes within them.

Note:  When using this feature the first segment of your URI must specify the folder.
 For example, lets say you have a controller located here:
    </p>
    </div>
